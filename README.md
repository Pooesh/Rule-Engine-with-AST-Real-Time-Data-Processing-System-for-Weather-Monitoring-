# Rule-Engine-with-AST-Real-Time-Data-Processing-System-for-Weather-Monitoring-
"This repository includes a Rule Engine using Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for dynamic user eligibility evaluation and a Real-Time Weather Monitoring System. The Rule Engine allows flexible rule creation/modification, while the Weather System fetches, analyzes, and visualizes live weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API for Indian metros."

Rule Engine with Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
Overview
This project implements a Rule Engine that leverages an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to evaluate user eligibility based on various dynamic attributes such as age, department, income, and spending. It allows for flexible rule creation, modification, and combination through a simple UI, API, and backend.

Features
Dynamic rule creation, combination, and modification.
Flexible rule conditions based on user attributes.
RESTful API for managing rules.
Simple and intuitive user interface for interacting with the rule engine.
Backend architecture for efficient rule processing and evaluation using AST.
Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js (or your preferred framework)
Backend: Node.js/Express (or other backend)
Database: MongoDB (or your preferred database)
API: RESTful API
Other Tools: Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser

Real-Time Data Processing System for Weather Monitoring**

Overview
This project is a Real-Time Data Processing System that monitors weather conditions using data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It fetches, processes, and analyzes weather data for various metro cities across India, providing daily summaries, configurable alert thresholds, and visualizations for weather trends.

Features
Real-time weather data fetching from the OpenWeatherMap API.
Analyze and visualize weather data for multiple cities.
User-configurable alert thresholds for specific weather conditions.
Daily summaries of temperature, humidity, and other key metrics.
Weather trend visualizations (e.g., graphs for temperature over time).
Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js/Chart.js (or your preferred visualization tools)
Backend: Node.js/Express (or other backend)
API: OpenWeatherMap API
Database: MongoDB (or your preferred database)
